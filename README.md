# Leads Django/React App

- I will be following this [tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbRA-CIUxlxkUpbq0IFkX60)

- I want to see the difference ways of implementing React with Django and Spring Boot).

# Some Notes

- The initial upload will have the changes after video 1.
- I plan to create branches for each of the videos and so that would mean that if I need to refer to code at the start of video 3 I would grab the branch for the end of video 2.
