- frontend/src/components: where react/redux contents will reside
- frontend/static/frontend: where our compiled javascript will reside
  - the contents of this is generated by something such as "npm run build" from whenever create-react-app was used.
- frontend/static/templates: where our index.html is (the SPA).

- npm init: creates package.json file with all the javascript dependencies.
  - "-y" is an argument to use defaults.
- npm i -D webpack webpack-cli

  - '-D': dev dependency

- gitignore generated from [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/)

- npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-plugin-transform-class-properties

- npm i react react-dom prop-types

  - scripts's "dev" key:
    - we want to look index.js inside of the src folder and output it to the static folder.
    - "main.js" is what we will be including inside of index.html in order to render React components.
